# Kata Practice

## Closest To Zero

I'm unsure of the origins of this kata, but this version was introduced to me by [srvance](https://github.com/srvance).

* Write a function `closest(xs)` which, given a list of integers, returns the number in the list which is closest to zero.
* If two items have the same size but different signs, return the positive value.
